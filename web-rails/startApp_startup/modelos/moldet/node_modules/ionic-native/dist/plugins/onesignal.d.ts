 * @name OneSignal
 * @description
 * The OneSignal plugin is an client implementation for using the [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) Service.
 * OneSignal is a simple implementation for delivering push notifications.
 *
 * Requires Cordova plugin: `onesignal-cordova-plugin`. For more info, please see the [OneSignal Cordova Docs](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/phonegap-sdk-installation).
 *
 * @usage
 * ```typescript
 * import { OneSignal } from 'ionic-native';
 *
 * let notificationOpenedCallback(jsonData: any) {
 *   console.log('didReceiveRemoteNotificationCallBack: ' + JSON.stringify(jsonData));
 * };
 *
 * OneSignal.init('b2f7f966-d8cc-11e4-bed1-df8f05be55ba',
 *                        {googleProjectNumber: '703322744261'},
 *                        notificationOpenedCallback);
 *
 * OneSignal.enableInAppAlertNotification(true);
 * ```
